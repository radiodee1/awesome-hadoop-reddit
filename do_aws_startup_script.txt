## use this script to download Reddit Comments on startup of instance !! ##
#
# We use a single instance of aws elastic beanstalk to download the 
# reddit comments file. Then we move it to s3 storage. Then we start up
# an EMR cluster and run our mapper and reducer on that.
#
# You may ssh into the aws beanstalk ubuntu instance and execute:
# sudo apt install awscli
# Then you could move the RC_2017-11 file over to s3 using aws cli tools.
#
# On the aws EMR cluster that I used python 3.6 was not available.
# They use 2.7 or 3.4.
# mapper.py and reducer.py had to be changed to allow for the
# available python version.
#
# Something else to note, the hadoop cluster needs to create its own
# output directory. If you specify for hadoop a s3 directory for output 
# that exists it will crash and you will have to try again.
